## Raw Notes

We started at [[Boil's Hut]]

[[Bask]] seems intelligent. and after blowing the whistle three times she bolts to go look for truffles.
the first thing she dug up is a petrified humanoid bone. it feels like stone. underneath the bone was a collection of truffles 5 truffles.

next is a collection of spines and a membrane.  in this hole she found metal. it ended up being a pipe of some sort. super rusty and deteriorating. [[Anya]] determined the rust could be valuable. this s a huge pipe. 3ft pipe diameter.

3lbs of rust and metal.

there was someone at the bottom of the hole who saw us them walked off to the north. he was [[Vveird]]. we determined the spine plant was feeding off the metal and want to keep an eye out for more of it.

we decided to go in. the man was just standing over a body staring at us.
we decided to go to the skeleton to get the truffles.
the figure was transparent as we got closer. the skelly had an arrow in it. inside it is truffles.
the arrow still looks brand new. runes on the haft and feathers.
i collected the body in a cloak and set to send it off in a proper burial.
the spirit seemed confused and in awe of the surroundings.
[[Anya]] keeps the arrow.

[[Whitebeard]]  patch. [[Bask]] is rooting around when we got ambushed by noblins

we killed two and the third surrendered. we decided to spare his life, feed him, and call him friend. 
[[Dirk Stonejaw]] convinced him to eat his old companions
the noblin decided to follow us. 
we got the rest of the truffles.

the noblin wanted me to heal his friend but i could not. we have deemed the noblin to be named [[Name]].

when we got back [[Boil]] was moving some of the peat bricks.

[[Boil]] is unamused with us taking in [[Name]]

[[Vveird]] has expressions that linger after magical effects. he hints others would know more, but they would be in [[The Mire]].
we have a connection to the origination of our [[Vveird]]. so all of us share the same "signature"

when asked about the pipe. occasionally [[The Dim]] belches up things. this could be a sewer from a nearby historical city.
the membrane in the spine plant is a paralytic. it feeds off of iron and rust.

askeed about ghost.
we released a spirit. let it move on.

the arrow is [[Vveird]] touched. he is curious what would happen if we broke it.
the only one who can identify [[mysteries]] are [[Shale]]

[[Anya]] Snaps the arrow to gain the benifit. she gets +1 to her strength.

we can look hunt down [[The Pile]]
boil starts t like name.

after we left  we went back to the tunnels to explore.
 in each corner of the room there is a stone statue
 in the center of the room there is a hole, a pit.  it is about 10ft down. down there is just mud and dirt the grating has fallen to make metal spikes.

the statue is of some sort of animal crouching. they are frogs with their mouth wide open.

we found a glowing gold and blue mushroom. a [[Boldcap]]. we were able to harvest a good chunk of it.
