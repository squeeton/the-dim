## Raw Notes


starting in the destruction. ash falling. frozen beam of smoke.

smoke rising from the bark of a tree. a strange pattern 7 feet off the ground. facing away from [[Hardmire]]
there is a pattern in there. technically writing. but we dont know what writing is. spiraling, with thorns with unnatural repitition.
this is a rune, 

[[Darius Ravenscar]] tried to commit this symbol to memory. i do but it give me the fears.

everyone is dead.

[[Ajax]] put his hand in the smoke and it reacted to the light inside of him.

[[Darius Ravenscar]] collected some of the casing that protected them.

the cloud started to reverse blossom. it was covering the [[Everpot]], which is now sucking up the smoke.no one knows how to do an investigation.
this is the most empty [[Everpot]] ever seen. theres barely slop at the bottom. 

the [[Everpot]] must be magic of some kind. we never recalled her doing anything magical. we never learned how she lost her eye. she has just always been missing it.

there were tiny versions of the rune on his scabbard and box from the [[Mystery Man]] he wore thick furs which are very uncommon in this area.
no tracks left to follow him


Ajax went looking through everything and found a tiny vest with a fuckload of pockets. 
I found a small stone disk my brother found when we were younger. 
[[Dirk Stonejaw]] found a small jar of "kimchi"

we continue to be unable to find tracks.
[[Anya]] hid to cry.  then searched [[Mother Ybah]]s house to try and find clues. also nothing there. burnt away.

a splash to the east. several splashes in the water. 
[[Ajax]] wanders into the water in search of splashing.
[[Dirk Stonejaw]] saw something serpentine coming right for us. its not something we have hunted before.

this looks like a huge [[Mud Slithers]] this is completely unheard of a beast this big. this thing is at least 75ft long.
it makes it to shore and slows down, head rising. golden eyes. its looking at one of the runes. 

i question it to ask if it knows who did this. it rises up even further looking at me. 
it speaks back in a whisper. it doesnt know our terms
it says our protections are fading. and wants to claim new territory. 
the runes on the [[Graybeards]] were protections. they snapped and are no longer working. 

Dirk introduces himself. the being is called [[Lost]] 
we asked about who put the protections there. asks if we killed her to claim this territory. 
if the runes are exposed she is dead. which says this is free territory.

it tastes the remains of the building. 15ft diameter body. much sacrifice here. we can have the territory. it is tainted. the sacrifices make it tainted. she was a vain one. 
[[Mother Ybah]] was not like this one. 
i asked about the protective carapace. it moves in close to me to inspect it. it smells like a predator. i feel goosebumps and fear responses from it. the breath is cold and smells like rotten meat. 
she said it is magic, [[Vveird]]

asks if we want to find the man instead of how to find him. we described him, he smells of revenge.

to kill a witch you destroy the eye. he intentionally brought the eye here before destroying it. strangely personal. 


the runes prevented [[Lost Ones]] from approaching us. 


witches are good at hiding. [[Lost]] cannot find more. we can't find any as strong as [[Mother Ybah]].
it says it doesn't want our tainted land and turns to leave. 

i end up brushing the scales. my [[Vveird|vveird]] leaves some magic behind on the touch. it was cold to the touch. 

we decided to head towards [[Reedswatch]]
near bedtime a waylight up ahead there is a 2 wheeled cart being pulled by a [[Gaunt]]  his gaunt is named steven. its holding a tarp covered cart. its currently headed away from us. carts are rare. we've never seen one but heard storied.
we dont see a rider. 

we decide to approach. 
whatever is underneath is lumpy and rises 6 feet above, blocking the view of the driver.
 we hear a whistling coming from the west. 25 yards ish.
 we found a 3 foot man taking a shit. destroyed feet, ugly and gnarled. mutton chops. two bears and teeth filed to points. 
 [[Ajax]] interrogated him mid shit.
 his name is [[Boil]], hes headed home. says we smell like a mortal. then askes if we want to get stabbed. 
 if we dont hide [[Vveird]] common folk will murder and lynch us.
 he reveals he has a light under him as well. its red instead of green though.
 he says he'll help us out and learn our new [[Vveird|vveird]] powers. 
 he says we should avoid towns until we learn to hide ourselves. 
we each took an attempt at hiding [[Vveird]] 

 he seemed interested in [[Lost]]. asked us about our territory.
 he asks us to complete a chore for information about the [[Mystery Man]]

[[Anya]] is worried about his sharp teeth and bloody [[Vveird]] aura
he can live a long time. when questioned about his intentions
he extended right of hearth and made and oath swearing to not harm us in his territory.
we need to walk his  [[Shoveltooth Boar]] , [[Bask]]
then he will tell us about the [[Mystery Man]] and show us how to hide our [[Vveird]]

 he is hauling logs of peat.
 as we got close [[Boil]] makes a symbol and drops an illusion to reveal his hut.
the only thing in here is a pair of massive iron boots slightly rusted. metal is super rare.

take her truffling. 
when she roots around in the muck, if you dig there we'll find something amazing.
the truffles are for trade. we can have half.

he mentioned that he's older than [[The Dim]]
he explained the sun to us.

he explains he would steal people and bring them back to the fae then bleed them and dip their hats in there.
he keeps mentioning dragons. all dragons died. 

we spend the night there. he says the only time we need to worry about him is when he puts on his boots. 


3 toots starts the truffling
1 long to call her back.
