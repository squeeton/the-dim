## Raw Notes



we continued to explore the ruins. 
we passed the second entry and found a tunnel that fell into a giant hole.
there is a little bit of a walkway around the hole.
[[Dirk]] tied me off then held on to make sure i wasnt going to fall.

i was tied off and made my way around the catwalk. a 10 foot section fell and tinked the way to the ends of the earth. 
I'm able to open the door and revealed a tiny tunnel to a unexplored chamber.
[[Ajax]] joins me in the room. he takes a running jump across the missing section.
I pulled a lever and got myself trapped inside.

i found a metal sword.
silver strings
paper (( scroll probably))
unstrung bow



as im searching the room there is a rumbling,  and a tentacle came out and attacked the first movement it noticed ( the rope)
and took it back under
i tried to make it back and the ground fell below me. i fell but caught myself on some roots.
i broke the bone and there was paper inside. in frustration i was able to pull myself up to the other side. 
[[Ajax]] was throwing torches to make distractions from the monsters, plural.
we were able to make it out of there with [[Darius]] falling several times. 

there is  a comical moment where we destroyed all of the loot.
the shortsword has markings across the crossgaurd. I gave it to [[Dirk]] since he uses shortswords.

it ends up being a +1 shortsword


when we camped for the night there was a [[Sporefall]]
on the road there is a giant humanoid in the road in the distance. 
we decide to take a sneaky approach through.
this back monster wants to play hide and seek and counts to ten. we decide to run the f away.
